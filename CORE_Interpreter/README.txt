Once files are loaded into user's machine make sure to change directories into CORE_Interpreter folder to begin compilying and running files. Once in this directory, compile all files using the command "javac Main.java" this should compile all necessary files for project to run. To run the porgram in the command line enter "java Main <code file> <data file>" for instance one type of command could be "java Main Correct/0.code Correct/0.data". To run all test in the given "Correct" folder run the command "sh tester.sh" this will auto test the program against the first 10 test to ensure correctness than the next 6 tests will determine if the program is picking up execution errors correctly.
